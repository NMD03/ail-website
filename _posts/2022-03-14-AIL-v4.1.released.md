AIL Framework version 4.1 released with new investigation/case handling, improved MISP export and many improvements.

# Investigation in AIL

The major new functionality is the investigation handling in AIL. An analyst can now easily create investigation where
any objects from AIL can be added. This helps an analyst to build collection or cases to work on. The integration allows
to export it as a standard [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) event.

# Support for Jabber/XMPP

AIL has been extended to support Jabber/XMPP addresses. The source feeder just need to submit the keys such as `jabber:to`, `jabber:from`, `jabber:ts`, `jabber:id`.
An example feeder is [available](https://gist.github.com/gallypette/8e4fc941443a2483b6b2fcaee4c76e47). The new feature can be used to inject existing leak
or stream from XMPP/Jabber server. As an example, the Conti leak can be easily injected into AIL and show automatically all correlations between users.
