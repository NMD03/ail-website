title:  "AIL Framework version 4.0 released with new synchronisation feature, tracker webhook improvement and many bugs fixed."
author: adulau

AIL Framework version 4.0 has been released including a major new feature to allow synchronisation to other AIL instance(s).

The new synchronisation mechanism allow the sync from one AIL instance to another AIL using a standard WebSocket using AIL JSON protocol. The synchronisation
allows to filter and sync specific collected items including crawled items or specific tagged items matching defined rules. This feature can be very useful
to limit the scope of analysis in specific fields or ressource intensive activity. This sync can be also used to share filtered streams with other partners.

![Webhook configuration in AIL tracker](https://www.ail-project.org/assets/img/ail-webhook.png)

A new functionality has been added to trigger a webhook when a tracker is matched in AIL. This is in addition to email notification. The webhook can be used to trigger additional pipelines in AIL.

Additional API endpoints were added such `get_item_sources` `get_check_item_source` and `get_default_yara_rule_content`.

Thanks to the numerous external contributors such as Olivier Sagit and Tony Jabbour. A special thank for the webhook and API developed by Tony Jabbour from [CSIRT POST Cyberforce in Luxembourg](https://business.post.lu/grandes-entreprises/csirt).

The first version of the synchronisation protocol has been developed in the scope of the JTAN (Joint Threat Analysis Network), a CEF co-funded project (2020-EU-IA-0260).

Many bugs were fixed in this release and many small improvements were added.
