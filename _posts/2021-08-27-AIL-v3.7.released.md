AIL Framework version 3.7 released with many bugs fixed and improvement. The term tracker has been improved including the first_seen and last_seen. Various bugs were fixed and documentation improved. Thanks to all the contributors and especially Tony Jabbour for the new CentOS installation documentation. Thanks to Relega for the improved documentation about the pystemon integration. And a huge thank to @Fbroy for the new feeders: [Discord](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-feeder-discord), [ActivityPub feeder](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-feeder-activity-pub) and [RSS/Atom feeder](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-feeder-atom-rss). There is an ongoing feeder to include AIL2AIL synchronisation and a [first draft of the message format](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-exchange-format/blob/main/ail-stream.md) has been proposed. Feedback is more than welcome.
